# PewPew
A 2D shooter game created in Java. The game features standard weaponry, as well as a lightsaber and portal gun (reminscent of the portal weapon in the game Portal). The highlight of this game is the game's 'chunk' feature. Maps are randomly generated on the fly as the player enters new regions, and the chunk handler ensures that only the surrounding chunks are loaded so as to not use excessive memory, similar to the way in which Minecraft handles randomly generated terrain and chunk rendering.

To play, either download the game at https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhk31n9vvktcge2/PewPewShare.rar?dl=0, or clone this repository as a .ZIP, and run 'PewPewv2.jar'.
